## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution for a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge that consists on building a landing page that looks as close to the given design as possible. The goal is to improve my web layout skills by building a realistic project.

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

User should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
