## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge so I used React.js

User should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Able to scroll to view from navbar
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See if Email is valid
